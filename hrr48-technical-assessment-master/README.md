# The Technical Assessment

Ready to put your skills to the test and have some full-stack hacking fun? This assessment is like a day long solo sprint where you get to build a full stack JavaScript application using the skills and technologies you've worked with during the first half of the course. Expect to reinforce concepts and techniques you are familiar with and also to learn some new content.

## Before Starting

1. Confirm that all communication applications and tools are turned off, closed, put away
1. Clone this repo. Do not push your work any time during this assessment.

## Guidelines

You must manage your time effectively to complete this assessment. This assessment will be evaluated as if it was a coding challenge given to you as part of a job application process. Not only will the functionality of your code be important, but also, the professionalism with which you write it. Consider the style and organization of your code. Make frequent commits with informative and consistent commit messages. Be professional and informative with your comments.

Each directory contains a prompt with work for you to complete, with instructions defined in their own README.

## Available resources

The ultimate goal of this assessment is to give you an opportunity to demonstrate your abilities as an engineer. Avoid anything that will obscure our ability and your ability to see your best efforts at work will undermine that goal.

* You **may not** use a scaffolding tool (e.g. Yeoman) or starter repos unless specifically allowed in a prompt's README
* You **may not** use any resources created at Hack Reactor by yourself, other students, or staff members
  * e.g. lectures, sprints, MVP, past assessments, side projects, notes, mentor assignments, etc.
* You **may** only use online resources specifically allowed in a prompt's README
* You **may not** copy and paste from available online resources

## Submitting Your Work

Your work will be submitted with the `submit.sh` script located in the root directory of this repo. At 4:00 (or beforehand if you finish early):

1. Make a final commit
1. Fill out the `closing_comments.txt` file.
1. Commit the changes to `closing_comments.txt`.
    - NOTE: This commit should only contain changes to this file.
1. Run the script `bash submit.sh` to submit your code.
1. Reach out to help desk with a "ready to submit!" ticket once the script asks you for a server url. Keep an eye out on your Slack messages as help desk will not be joining video chats.
1. Do not log off until you receive a final confirmation from help desk that your submission was received.
