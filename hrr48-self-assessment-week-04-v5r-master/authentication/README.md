## Authentication
Explain why each system fails, and how to guard against that failure:
- Plaintext passwords: too easy to guess the password and there would be many attacks/infiltrations.

- Encrypted passwords: Encrypted passwords can technically be decrypted. If the attacker can guess how they encrypted, each symbol/letter/number has a specific translation and once they figure it out, it'd be easy to get all encrypted passwords decrypted.

- Hashed passwords: Some people may have the same hashed passwords in the end, which could result in confusing database retrieval. Salting passwords (adding more randomized letters/numbers/symbols) and then hashing them would be more secure.
